# Securing storybook using express on the vercel

This repository contains two set of approaches for vercel deployment using the azure devops pipeline.

The detailed explanaition can be found on my blog:

https://www.ashournia.com/basic-authentication-for-storybook/

The main idea can be used for any kind of hosting and the integration point using middle ware is possible with any kind of authentication provider(basic auth,OIDC with auth0/okta, ...)

For each deployment approach there is a set of pipeline and folders in the fe-app folder. you do not need to have both pipelines.
